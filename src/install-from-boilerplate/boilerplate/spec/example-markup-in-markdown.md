### Blockquote

> To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
No more;

### Content Insertion

Use the following format to pull in content from other files in your project:

<pre>
This text has been inserted here from another file: &#91;&#91;insert: assets/test.text&#93;&#93;
</pre>

This text has been inserted here from another file: [[insert: assets/test.text]]

You can even insert content within more complex blocks, like the JSON object below which is being pulled in and rendered in a syntax-highlighted example block:
<pre>
::: example Code Example
```json
&#91;&#91;insert: assets/test.json&#93;&#93;
```
:::
</pre>

::: example Code Example

```json
[[insert: assets/test.json]]
```

### TeX Math Equations

When the `katex` option is enabled, the KaTeX math engine is used for TeX rendering. You can find a list of supported features and examples here: <https://katex.org/docs/supported.html>.

$$\begin{pmatrix}x_2 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{pmatrix}\cdot
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}$$

$$\def\arraystretch{1.5}
   \begin{array}{c:c:c}
   a & b & c \\ \hline
   d & e & f \\
   \hdashline
   g & h & i
\end{array}$$

$$
\underbrace{a+b+c}_{\text{Note: such math, much wow.}}
$$

### Fancy Links

Spec-Up automatically upgrades the links of certain sites, like GitHub. GitHub is the only supported site with Fancy Links right now, but we'll be adding more as we go.
